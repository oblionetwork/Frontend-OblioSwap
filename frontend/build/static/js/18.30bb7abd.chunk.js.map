swap their tokens and coins across multiple blockchains.\n                        Pocket Swap pools tokens into smart contracts and users trade against these liquidity pools.\n                        Anyone can swap tokens or add tokens to a pool to earn fees.\n                        It obviates the need for trusted intermediaries, prioritizing\n                        decentralization, transparency, and security.\n                        To learn more about OKC and its benefits, visit this page https://www.okx.com/okc.</h5>\n                    </div>\n

transaction/trade on Pocket Swap.\n                        Around 83% of this fee is divided between the liquidity providers proportionally to their share.\n                        For example, if a user provides 50% of the poolâ€™s liquidity, he will earn 50% of the total collected fee.\n                        The remaining ~17% will go towards POCKET token holders, proportionally.\n                        The more tokens the user holds (stakes), the bigger the reward.\n                        This is called the Next-Gen Staking, a revolutionary method for users to stake their assets and earn passive income.\n                        In order to stake, the user is just required to hold POCKET tokens to receive rewards from the Pocket Swap trade fees.</h5>\n                    </div>\n

DeFi protocols/pools and is rewarded with a yield/reward,\n                        usually in the form of the platforms native token offering.\n\n                        Liquidity providers provide assets to the PocketSwap liquidity pools.\n                        In the return, they are compensated with a portion of the swap fees as a reward.\n                        In general, a flexible fee is taken by the pool contract on every transaction/trade on PocketSwap, aimed to be around 0.3%.\n                        And, 83% of this fee is divided between the liquidity providers proportionally to their share.\n                        For example, if a user provides 50% of the pool's liquidity, he will earn 50% of the collected fee.\n                        The remaining 17% of the fee will

           <h2>What are the Liquidity Pools?</h2>\n                      <h5>Liquidity Pools are pools of tokens, locked in a smart contract to facilitate trading by providing liquidity.\n                        They are used by Automated Market Makers (AMM) to reduce price change when trading on the decentralized exchanges.</h5>\n                    </div>\n                    <div>\n                      <h2>How to Deposit Assets to Pocket Swap Pools?</h2>\n                      <h5>Depositing assets on PocketSwap is completely permissionless and non\u0002custodial.\n                        Liquidity providers can add liquidity to existing pools.\n                        Once a new asset pool is listed, anybody can add liquidity to it, and from that perspective, PocketSwap is permissionless.\n                        The ability to use and withdraw assets is completely non-custodial.\n                        Only the original depositor has the ability to withdraw them, at any time.\n                        If a user wants to deposit for example USDT/ETH pair, the process will go through only if there is either USDT/POCKET or ETH/POCKET existing pair.\n                        Such act is necessary as we are converting fees to POCKET to pay the holders with an additional staking reward.</h5>\n                    </div>\n                    <br></br>\n

The deeper the liquidity, the lower the fee. However,\n                        deep pools generally have higher swap volume which generates more\n                        fee revenue.

Fees are paid by swappers and\n                        traders. The Liquidity providers are rewarded from the portion of the trade fees (~83%).\n                        Most swaps cause the ratio of assets in the liquidity pool to diverge from the market rate.\n                        The higher the trading volume on Pocket Swap, the higher the rewards for Liquidity Providers.\n                        Yield is paid out to liquidity providers when they remove/withdraw assets from the pool.</h5>\n                    </div>\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    <div>\n\n                      <h2>Pocket Token:\n\n                      </h2>\n                     <h5>\n                       \n\nThe complete XPocket ecosystem is powered by the dual chain token called POCKET token.\nPOCKET is built on Ethereum & OKC blockchains.\n<br></br>\n<h5>\nSymbol: POCKET\n</h5>\n<h5>\nType: ERC-20, OKC\n</h5>\n<h5>\nTotal Supply: 50,000,000 (25M on ETH, 25M on OKC)\n</h5>\nTo Learn more about the Distribution and Use cases of Pocket Token, visit our main website:\nhttps://xpocket.finance/pocket-token/\n                     </h5>\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </section>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <Footer />\n    </Fragment>\n  );\n\n}\n\nexport default Tokensale;"],"sourceRoot":""}
